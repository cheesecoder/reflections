When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share to the world and/or collaborate with other devs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes with remote repo may cause merge conflicts, so manual way allows to be prepared to resolve conflicts.
