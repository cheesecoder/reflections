When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share to the world and/or collaborate with other devs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes with remote repo may cause merge conflicts, so manual way allows to be prepared to resolve conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is cloning others repo to your github account on cloud, clone is like downloading remote repo of others or yours to your local machine. Branch is used add new feature or bugfix and merge back to master branch. Will use fork to clone other public repo and add new all new changes to cloned repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You always have the latest changes from remote locally, so you're upto date and contribute new features even you're off the grid.
