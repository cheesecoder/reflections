What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when you do git init, git creates a repo of the directory and starts tracking state of files. We need it start a repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is a intermediate state where you stage files which are complete and waiting to be commited along with other files from working directory (file we're currently working on). Its offers a clear workflow for the development.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Staging area can be used as a buffer to group together(ready to be commited) the changed files related to single logical change.
